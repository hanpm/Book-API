# Book-API
Creating an API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to manage a collection of books. 

### About me
> ðŸ‘‹ Hello, everyone! Allow me to introduce myself. I'm [Han](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hmp36/), a recent, 1st-gen. CS grad from California State University, Long Beach, who's *hungry* for a chance at Erewhon! While I'm still a novice when it comes to implementing the MERN stack, this project has been a enjoyable experience for me. There is certainly room for improvement, and I hope to talk further about the project and Erewhon's technology soon.  

## Project Description 
### Technologies Used
Technology used in this project are [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). 

### Features to implement in the future
There are couple things that I came in mind when completing (& researching) for this project. 

1) Implementing more features to the API
- *I frequent the library a lot and here's some useful features to include:*
    - Adding genres and sorting by genres. 
    - Having a count of each inventory. 

2) Refactoring with better [MVC architecture](https://medium.com/@ansari028amaan/understanding-mvc-architecture-in-the-mern-stack-5cc083828298#:~:text=The%20MVC%20architecture%20provides%20a,a%20more%20efficient%20development%20process.)
- Adhering to a structured architecture is important for creating scalable, reusable, and organized applications. I have already began to separate the code into its appropriate folders. With more time, I would better organize my code according to the embedded link.

2) Complete the [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack)
- Currently, this project is only a part of the MERN stack. 
- We need to also implement a frontend, **React**, to complete this stack and make this project a full-stack application.
